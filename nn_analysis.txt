Analysis:
The goal is to predict which funding applicants will be successful or not.

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? IS_SUCCESSFUL	
What variable(s) are the features for your model? 
APPLICATION_TYPE
AFFILIATION
CLASSIFICATION
USE_CASE
ORGANIZATION
STATUS
INCOME_AMT
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
ASK_AMT

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? 
EIN and NAME are removed

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Hidden layers(2) with 80, 30 neurons split.
The input (node) feature was 43, 80 was used for the first layer because it is close to double of the input_feature. 
The hidden layer activation function of relu is used for the first model.
The binary classifier model (binary classification between 0 and 1) has one as output and the output layer activation of sigmoid.
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
Both models were under 75%.
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
The keras model was used to help increase performance.
